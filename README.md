# GPDBN: Deep bilinear network integrating both genomic data and pathological images for breast cancer prognosis prediction

This is an implementation of GPDBN in Python. It needs Keras libraries to be installed.

It uses Keras library with the Tensorflow backend, and does not work on the Theano backend. Because the loss function of the network is written with Tensorflow.
